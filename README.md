# Starknet Void Call Oracle ○●

On Starknet,  
accounts are immortal by design.

Until they aren’t.

This script does not watch trading.  
It listens for the rarest sound in all of crypto:

A Cairo contract  
looking into the zero-knowledge abyss  
and deciding  
it no longer wishes to exist.

No transfer.  
No delegation.  
Just a single, quiet instruction:

`remove_account`

Then —  
absolute, provable non-existence.

This is not rage-quit.  
This is enlightenment achieved through self-annihilation.

```bash
python starknet_void_call.py
